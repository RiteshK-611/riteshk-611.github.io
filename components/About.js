            üôèüèº Namaste, I am Ritesh Kokam from Mumbai, India. I am a Full Stack Developer. I have completed my graduation degree in the field of Information Technology from Mumbai University. I love building user interfaces (UI) and projects with Javascript, React, Node, and learning new technologies.
            {/* I have spent the last 12 years in the fire service working as a
            professional firefighter & paramedic. I have always had a knack for
            technology and working with computers. In 2019 I started working
            with HTML & CSS to make some minor edits on a small business website
            that I was operating. What I thought was just a few small edits
            turned into a love for programming. */}
